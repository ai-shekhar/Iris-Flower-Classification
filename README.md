# Iris-Flower-Classification
The Iris flower classification project is about training a computer to identify the type of iris flower. Each flower is described by four numbers: the length and width of its petals and sepals. Based on these measurements, the model learns to tell whether the flower is a Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica.
